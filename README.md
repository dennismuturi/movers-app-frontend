# Phase 4 Final Project : Muziki App

## Focus 🎯
Building a Movers App that uses react for user interfaces and Ruby on Rails for backend API creation

## Learning Goals 👨‍🚀
- Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions.
- Build a backend API using Ruby on Rails that allows for CRUD operation

## Frontend Setup ✴️
- [x] cd into movers-app-frontend back-end folder and run `npm install  --legacy-peer-deps` from your terminal which will install all the dependecies
- [x] Finally run `npm start` to keep your backend running on `http://127.0.0.1:4000` :boom:
